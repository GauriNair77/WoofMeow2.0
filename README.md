Project Description
~ A satirical dating app designed for pets (dogs, cats, birds, and small animals) that:
~ Lets owners create profiles and "match" their pets with other animals
~ Features animal "languages" (Woof, Meow, Chirp, Squeak) with absurd translations
~ Includes ridiculous compatibility metrics (butt-sniffing approval, nap schedules, etc.)
~ Offers pointless premium features like "Treat Translator" and "Paw-ssport"

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
~ Lonely Pets?
~ Human Dating Apps Are Exhausting.
~ What If They Donâ€™t Get Along?

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Making a dating app for pets.
